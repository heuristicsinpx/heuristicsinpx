### 👩‍💻 About Me
I moved from development into Product Design because I enjoy listening to users, understanding their stories, and shaping clear, thoughtful solutions that improve their everyday experiences.

I have a **Bachelor’s in IT Engineering** and an **MSc in Human-Computer Interaction from the University of Nottingham, UK**,  

I’ve shaped digital experiences through roles in **UX Design**, **Development**, and **Graphic Design**.
